h2. Usage

h3. First Clone the Repository

<pre>
user:~$ git clone https://github.com/tenkosky/branden-s-mom.git
user:~$ cd branden-s-mom
</pre>

h3. Download MathJax

The slides need MathJax to translate the LaTeX to html.  The easiest way to get it is to clone the repo.

<pre>
user:~/branden-s-mom$ git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax.git
</pre>

This creates a directory 'MathJax' in the 'branden-s-mom' folder. Depending on your OS, you might have to change the folder name to 'mathjax'. 

h3. View

<pre>
user:~/branden-s-mom$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:3000":http://0.0.0.0:3000/ in your browser to view the slides.
